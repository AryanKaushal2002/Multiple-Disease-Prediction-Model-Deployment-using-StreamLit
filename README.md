## About

*This web app provides a user-friendly interface to predict multiple diseases based on various input features. The machine learning models used in this application are trained on relevant datasets to make accurate predictions.*

The diseases currently supported by this web app include:
- Diabetes
- Parkinson's disease
- Heart disease
- Breast cancer

## Web App

- [Access the Web App](https://multiple-disease-prediction-using-ml.streamlit.app/) - Use the web app to predict multiple diseases.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/AryanKaushal2002/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Model-Deployment-using-StreamLit.git
</pre>


2. Install the required dependencies:
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>



## Usage

1. Run the web app:
<pre>
streamlit run app.py
</pre>

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the web app.

3. Select the disease prediction page you want to use and provide the required input features.

4. Click on the **Test Result** button to generate the prediction result.

## Models

The machine learning models used in this web app are trained on publicly available datasets specific to each disease. Here is a brief description of each model:

- Diabetes Model: This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

- Parkinson's Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of Parkinson's disease in a person based on features extracted from voice recordings.

- Heart Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features of a person.

- Breast Cancer Model: This model predicts whether a breast mass is malignant or benign using features derived from breast cytology.
